# your-css
A simple CSS library for you

### Introduction

Are you a backend developer? You want to build an awesome website but have a mess with CSS frameworks, etc? Are they too difficult to learn?

Try my CSS library, it's very simple and easy to use. Just include minified CSS (and a JS config file) to your HTML. You'll love it.

### How to use?

Using NPM or Yarn to install dev dependencies:

```
npm install
yarn install
```

And run following command to build production

```
npm run build
yarn run build
```
